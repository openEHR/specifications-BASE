= Class Features

== Overview

Within the definitions of each class in a BMM model are found the definitions of its _features_, consisting of _routines_, _properties_ and _constants_. The overall meta-model of features, as well as the elements that occur within them, namely parameters and local variables is shown below, and described in this section.

The abstract classes in this model that define the taxonomy of types are as follows:

* `BMM_FORMAL_ELEMENT`: a formally defined element with a scope and signature;
* `BMM_ROUTINE`: an element whose definition is a compututation;
* `BMM_VALUE_RETURNING`: any element that has a value at execution time;
* `BMM_EVALUABLE`: any element that can be evaluated at execution time to produce a value;
* `BMM_MUTABLE`: a non-computed evaluable element whose value may be changed during execution;
* `BMM_VARIABLE`: a mutable element whose scope is a routine.

Class features consist of the formal sub-parts of a class, namely:

* _routines_: _procedures_ and _functions_;
* _properties_: mutable static definitions, described in detail in previous sections;
* _constants_: immutable static definitions.

== Scope of Formal Elements

All formally defined model elements (i.e. instances of the meta-type `BMM_FORMAL_ELEMENT`) have a _scope_, represented by the `_scope_` meta-attribute. The scope meta-type indicates the kind of model element within which the current element is scoped, and the value 

== Nullability, Optionality and Void-safety

The `_is_nullable_` attribute of the meta-class `BMM_MUTABLE` indicates whether instances are optional or mandatory within their context, i.e. whether the value of the reference may be null (or 'void') at execution or persistence time. This flag maps on to the UML notion of optionality (i.e. whether a property or routine parameter has `[0..1]` existence) and also to the broader notion of void-safety.

== Differential and Flat Form

In modelling or programming terms, the features defined on a particular class within a model constitute the features it _introduces with respect to its inheritance parent(s)_. We can think of this list of features as the _differential_ set. A 'top-level' class with no declared inheritance ancestor is considered to inherit by default from the `Any` class, and its feature set is relationally differential to the top class.

In contrast, the _effective_ set of features for an instance at runtime is the result of evaluating these lists of features down the inheritance hierarchy to obtain the _flat_ set of features. The features _properties_ and _flat_properties_ defined on `BMM_CLASS` provide access to these two lists for any class.

== Signatures

All class features have formal signatures. The simplest type of signature is that of properties and constants, which may be expressed formally as follows:

----
    : T_result
----

This indicates that both meta-types have a return type, being the type of the value they are attached to at execution time.

The two types of routines, i.e. functions and procedures include 0 or more formal parameters in their signatures, with functions also having a return type. The general form of routine signatures is thus as follows:

----
    <T_arg1, T_arg2, ....>: T_result        -- Function
    <T_arg1, T_arg2, ....>                  -- Procedure
----

Typical examples of function signatures:

----
    : Date                          -- signature of a 0-order function like current_date()
    <Real, Real>: Real              -- signature of a 2nd-order function like '*' for the domain R
    <Integer, Integer>: Integer     -- signature of a 2nd-order function like 'add' for the domain I
----

Typical procedure signatures include the following:

----
    <Real>                          -- a 1st-order procedure for the domain R
    <String, Integer>               -- signature of a procedure taking a String and an Integer argument
----

== Constants

Constant features in a class are represented by the BMM meta-class `BMM_CONSTANT`, which is an immutable descendant of `BMM_EVALUABLE`. A constant has a `_value_`, which may be of any type, including complex types. The `_scope_` of a constant is its enclosing class.

NOTE: computed complex constants not yet supported.

== Properties

Class properties are defined via the meta-class `BMM_PROPERTY`, and its two subtypes, `BMM_UNITARY_PROPERTY` and `BMM_CONTAINER_PROPERTY`, corresponding to the unitary and container type meta-types. The `BMM_PROPERTY` meta-type defines semantics common to all properties, including `_type_`, a reference to an instance of `BMM_TYPE` representing the class property type in the BMM model. Properties also include two other Boolean meta-data items, `_is_im_runtime_` and `_is_im_infrastructure_`, which can be used to classify property values in a model according to use in runtime systems. These may be individually set, or both may be False. The three meaningful value settings are as follows:

* _both False_: the value of the property is considered to be design-time constrainable;
* _is IM runtime_: True if the property value is only knowable at runtime, as is typically the case for identifiers, dates etc;
* _is infrastructure_: True if the property is not a user- or business-oriented property, but something required by software design, e.g instance identifier, meta-data etc.

Single-valued properties in a BMM model are instances of the type `BMM_UNITARY_PROPERTY`, and have as their `_type_` the meta-type `UNITARY_TYPE`. Container properties are instances of the type `BMM_CONTAINER_PROPERTY`, which adds the meta-attribute `_cardinality_`, enabling the possible number of container elements to be constrained (this corresponds to the multiplicities used at the end of UML associations).

The following example shows a the flattened property view of a class `OBSERVATION` in a BMM model whose flat properties have different settings of the `_is_im_runtime_` and `_is_im_infrastructure_` meta-data flags: property names in black are neither; those in grey are IM runtime, and those in light grey are infrastructure properties.

== Functions and Procedures

Functions and procedures are kinds of _routine_, which are computational features of a class. In BMM, they are represented, along with constituent parts, namely parameters and local variables by descendants of the class `BMM_FORMAL_ELEMENT`.

The formal parameter definitions of both kinds of routines are represented by an ordered list of instances of the meta-class `BMM_PARAMETER`, which is understood as a kind of _variable_ scoped to the owning routine. A formal parameter may optionally have the read/write direction defined, which indicates whether the variable contains an input value, should only be written to, or both, i.e. read then written to. The inherited `_is_nullable_` meta-attribute indicates whether each parameter is mandatory or not.

An additional feature of the meta-model for functions is the notion of _operator_, which supports the representation of a function call in a formal expression as an operator symbol with one or two operands, in the typical form found in programming languages and first order logics. The BMM approach considers an operator as an optional addition to any function of `_arity_` 1 or 2 that may reasonably be represented in an abstract syntax using operator syntax. Operators thus support the use of expressions like `weight > 90` to mean `weight.gt (90)`, where `weight` is of type `Real`, and the function `gt(other: Real)` is defined.

== Variables, Objects and Values

At the finest level of detail of a model definition are what are typically thought of as (local) _variables_ and (literal) _values_. These are represented by the classes `BMM_LOCAL` and `BMM_VALUE` respectively. Both variables and values have a `_type_`, with type being inferred for the latter from its value when parsed or otherwise created.
