= Preface

== Purpose

This document describes the Basic Meta-Model (BMM), a model of object models. It may be considered as an approximate replacement for the UML XMI. It is human-readable and writable, and supports generic types (open and closed), container types, and multiple inheritance.

== Status

This specification is in the {spec_status} state. The development version of this document can be found at {openehr_base_bmm}[{openehr_domain}/releases/BASE/latest/bmm.html].

Known omissions or questions are indicated in the text with a 'to be determined' paragraph, as follows:

*TBD*: (example To Be Determined paragraph)

Users are encouraged to comment on and/or advise on these paragraphs as well as the main content.  Feedback should be provided either on the {openehr_technical_list}[technical mailing list], or on the {openehr_jira_prs_base}[specifications issue tracker].

NOTE: Other than for working with particular tools designed to use BMM, BMM is not a required formalism for implementing openEHR, and other methods of accessing models computably may be used, including UML and software implementations of the openEHR Reference Model.

== Previous Versions

=== Version 3.0.0

This version made major changes to the `BMM_TYPE` hierarchy and semantics, enabling generic inheritance by generic and non-generic classes to be represented.

=== Version 3.1.0

This version adds meta-classes for routines, variables and constants to the BMM, and makes some small adjustments to the existing model attributes and classes. The BMM remains compatible with P_BMM 2.x, i.e. any existing `.bmm` file can be parsed to create a v 3.1.0 BMM instance.

== A Note on Language

The elements of meta-models are sometimes named confusingly in the literature and within various programming language technologies. In this specification, we have used the following terms:

feature (of a class):: any stored or computed element of a class, including constants, attributes (properties) and routines (methods);
property:: a stored class feature; also known as 'attribute';
routine:: a computed class feature that may be either value-returning (a function) or work-performing (a procedure);
function:: a routine that computes and returns a value; typically causes no side-effects in the object;
procedure:: a routine that performs a computation; typically has side-effects;
generic (class or type):: a kind of class or type that has parameters of other types; known as 'template' type in some programming languages.

== Tooling

The {openehr_awb}[openEHR ADL Workbench (AWB)] fully implements this specification, and provide a convenient way of illustrating BMM semantics. The screenshots used in this specification are all from the ADL Workbench. The tool is written in the Eiffel language, and is available as {openehr_awb_github}[open source on Github]. The BMM libraries can be found in the {eomf_bmm}[EOMF Github repository].

A modelling tool known as Archie implements BMM in Java, and {openehr_archie_github}[can be found in the openEHR Github area].
