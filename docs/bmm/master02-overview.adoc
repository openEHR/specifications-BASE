== Introduction

One of the key needs in any open computing environment is a computable representation of its own models. This is for a number of purposes, including reasoning about them, performing validation and consistency checking, building software and generating documentation. This is particularly true of openEHR and other archetype-based frameworks, where a further need is to be able to validate archetypes and templates with respect to the reference model, and also to validate runtime instance data against operational templates and the reference model.

A number of computable representations of the openEHR published models have been available in the past. Currently models are represented in two computable forms, namely UML and BMM (i.e. the format described in this specification).

The primary use of the UML expression is for specification publishing. In this role, UML diagrams and static models are built, and then post-processed to correct signatures of class properties and functions. The post-processing corrects UML's shortcomings and errors in non-singular relations, generic (template) types, and qualified attributes. The result can be used for publishing documentation with feature signatures that are formally correct and will be understood by developers in most programming languages. It can also be serialised and used computably, e.g. in other visualisation or modelling tools. UML's own serial format, XMI is thus generally unsuitable for such uses, due to the formal errors, as well as its excessive complexity. XMI is also notoriously non-standard across UML tools.

As a result, openEHR introduced the Basic Meta-Model (BMM) in 2009 as a way of representing correct object-oriented semantics of information models for use in tools, along with a serial format by default expressed in the {openehr_odin}[openEHR ODIN syntax]. 

The BMM provides a standalone alternative to UML/XMI which correctly represents all types, including open and closed generic types, inheritance of generic types, and various other problems with UML. As a meta-model it is adapted to the task, i.e. representing entity types that can appear in object models, rather than the over-generalised semantics of the UML meta-model. This reduced scope, and the fact that it contains no diagram semantics enables its serial form to be very human-readable. 

NOTE: Other than for working with particular tools designed to use BMM, BMM is not a required formalism for implementing openEHR, and other methods of accessing models computably may be used, including UML and software implementations of the openEHR Reference Model.

== Current State of the Art

=== UML

One would expect that the IT industry would have fully computable representations of models and diagramming solved, but it is not yet the case. UML 2.x and its associated serialisation format XMI 2.x should in theory mean that complete, interoperable machine expressions of object models would be available in all tools. However the evolution of UML and XMI has not been toward a clear meta-model and language for each of its sub-languages (i.e. static class model, state machine, interaction diagram etc) but rather toward a single universal model of everything in which elements of all of its needs are confusingly buried. 

The UML 2.x specifications are exceedingly complex: UML 2.1.2 was specified by two documents, 'Superstructure' (738pp) and 'Infrastructure' (224pp); the UML 2.5.1 specification is only slightly smaller at 796 pages (see the {uml}[OMG UML page] for current specifications). The XMI 2.x specification is correspondingly complex, which seems to have so far prevented reliable tool interoperability (recognised as a critical issue by OMG in 2015). Despite the complexity, there are significant holes in the UML meta-model, including: the notion of 'type' is not formalised and the meta-model of generic types and container properties is problematic and does not map well to object programming languages. The Design By Contract (DbC) concept (i.e. pre-, post-conditions, class invariants), crucial for proper specifications, is in theory supported via the use of OCL 2.0 constraints in class definitions, but OCL suffers from the underlying semantic weaknesses as UML.

Experience with various UML tools (up till 2015) highlighted the following problems:

* poor support for OCL and design by contract in most tools;
* variable support for generic (i.e. template) classes; even those tools that properly implement the UML 2.5 specification are still very hard to use for defining generic classes because of problems in the specification that remain unaddressed;
* problems with qualified attributes, which are used to represent identifier references to objects rather than direct references;
* variable support for XSD generation across tools, where the results are wildly wrong in some tools;
* in some tools, it is impossible to define an abstract formal model - the only option is to select a particular programming language profile such as Java or C# and thus get locked into the limitations of those languages (messy type systems, weak inheritance semantics, language-specific notion of types such as `Array<T>`, `List<T>`, etc.).

Since 2015, the quality of UML tools has improved, and the XMI generated by some is more reliable. However, XMI generated by different tools is not the same for identical models, and some XMI importers offer numerous switches in order to process the XMI of another tool properly. XMI thus still needs to be processed with care.

Nevertheless, a small number of tools, including MagicDraw (currently used for representing openEHR models for the specifications) and Rational Software Architect (RSA), appear to implement UML 2.5 faithfully. This means that despite the limitations of UML 2.5 (as noted above), models expressed in it can be mostly correctly interpreted and post-processed for purposes such as code generation.

NOTE: Other tools may well perform as well or better, and in any case, all tools change over time. No endorsement of a particular tool is intended here.

=== XML Schema

For some, XML-schema represents a way of expressing object models, but it is not semantically suitable for this purpose, primarily due to its problematic non-object-oriented inheritance semantics, lack of generic classes, no representation of non-data members, and only marginal support for design by contract. It can be and is often used (including in openEHR) as a derivative serialisation representation.

== Design Approach

The Basic Meta-Model supports the representation of object models in the ISO RM/ODP information point of view. It is designed to enable both human authoring and machine extraction (e.g. from a UML tool or programming language classes) of textual schemas. The semantics of the model are heavily influenced by the formal approach to object-orientation described by Bertrand Meyer in Object-oriented Software Construction <<Meyer_OOSC2>> and also the {eiffel_ecma_367}[Eiffel language], which is significantly better match to object modelling than the UML 2.x meta-model.

Currently the BMM supports only the information point of view, i.e. no methods. It is oriented toward developing models of data. Tools that use the BMM can provide views of an object model expressed in BMM that are particularly useful to information modelling, such as 'closure' view show below. This is a computed reachability graph of a fully inheritance-flattened class and all properties, including recursive references.

One of the main uses of the BMM in the ADL Workbench and other similar tools is to provide a computable form of the information model for use with domain-level content models, such as {openehr_am}[archetypes]. The following shows an archetype for which each node has its class shown (in colour), and additionally, the inclusion of non-archetyped attributes from the classes of the archetype nodes.

== Specification Structure

This specification defines a BMM object model, i.e. the in-memory object structure of a BMM. The related {openehr_base_bmm_persistence}[BMM Persistence specification] defines an object model for a serialised schema form. The latter enables serialisation of a BMM into a concrete syntax such as ODIN, JSON or XML.

The BMM packages are as follows:

* `bmm`: the BMM
** `rm_access`: the interface to most features including schema load/reload, generally used by an application as a reflection library;
** `core`: the core BMM classes used for in-memory representation of an object model;

These are illustrated below.
