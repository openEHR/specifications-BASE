= Identification

== Identification of the EHR

In an openEHR system, each EHR has a unique identifier, known as the EHR id, found in the root
EHR object of each EHR. EHR ids should be "strong" globally unique identifiers such as reliably created
Oids or Guids. *No single system should contain two EHRs for the same subject.* If this is not
the case, it means that the EHR system has failed to detect the existence of an EHR for a subject, or
failed to match provided demographic attributes to the subject.

In a distributed environment, the correspondence of EHR ids to subjects (i.e. patients) is variable, and
depends on the level of integration of the environment. In non-integrated or sporadically connected
environments, the same patient is likely to have a separate EHR at each institution, each with its own
unique EHR id, but the same subject id. If copies of parts of the patient EHR at one location is
requested by another provider, the received items will be merged into the local EHR for that patient.
Merges of persistent Compositions in such circumstances are likely to require human intervention.
Multiple EHR ids per patient in a distributed context are evidence of a lack of systematic connectivity
or identification service.

In a fully integrated distributed environment, the typical patient will still have local EHRs in multiple
locations, but each carrying the same EHR id. When a patient presents in a new location, a request to
the environment’s identification service could be made to determine if there is already an EHR for
this patient. If there is, a clone of all or part of the existing EHR could be made, or a new empty EHR
could be created, but in all cases, the EHR id would be the same as that used in other locations for the
same patient.

Note that the above logic only holds where the EHR in each location is an openEHR EHR.

== Identification of Items within the EHR

=== General Scheme

While identification of EHRs is not completely definable by openEHR, the identification of items
within an EHR is fully defined. The scheme described here requires two kinds of "identifier": identifiers
proper and references, or locators. An identifier is a unique (within some context) symbol or
number given to an object, and usually written into the object, whereas a reference is the use of an
identifier by an exterior object, to refer to the object containing the identifier in question. This distinction
is the same as that between primary and foreign keys in a relational database system.

In the openEHR RM, identifiers and references are implemented with two groups of classes defined
in the `support.identification` package. Identifiers of various kinds are defined by descendant
classes of `OBJECT_ID`, while references are defined by the classes inheriting from `OBJECT_REF`. The
distinction is illustrated in the following figure. Here we see two container objects with `OBJECT_IDs` (since
`OBJECT_ID` is an abstract type, the actual type will be another `XXX_ID` class), and various
`OBJECT_REFs` as references.

=== Levels of Identification

In order to make data items locatable from the outside, identification is supported at 3 levels in
openEHR, as follows:

* _version containers_: `VERSIONED_OBJECTs` (Common IM) are identified uniquely;
* _top-level content structures_: content structures such as `COMPOSITION`, `EHR_STATUS`, `EHR_ACCESS`, `PARTY` etc. are uniquely identified by the association of the identifier of their containing `VERSIONED_OBJECT` and the identifier of their containing `VERSION` within the container;
* _internal nodes_: nodes within top-level structures are identified using paths.

Three kinds of identification are used respectively. For version containers, meaningless unique identifiers
("UIDs") are used. In most cases, the type `HIER_OBJECT_ID` will be used, which contains an
instance of a subtype of the UID class, i.e. either an ISO OID or a IETF UUID (see
<<rfc_4122>>; also known as a GUID). In general UUIDs are favoured since they
require no central assignment and can be generated on the spot. A versioned container can be then referenced
with an `OBJECT_REF` containing its identifier.

Versions of top-level structures are identified in a way that is guaranteed to work even in distributed
environments where copying, merging and subsequent modification occur. The full identification of a
version of a top-level structure is the globally unique tuple consisting of the uid of the owning
`VERSIONED_OBJECT`, and the two `VERSION` attributes `_creating_system_id_` and `_version_tree_id_`. The
creating_system_id attribute carries a unique identifier for the system where the content was first created;
this may be a GUID, Oid or reverse internet identifier. The `_version_tree_id_` is a 1 or 3-part
number string, such as "1" or for a branch, "1.2.1". A typical version identification tuple is as follows:

```
F7C5C7B7-75DB-4b39-9A1E-C0BA9BFDBDEC    -- id of VERSIONED_COMPOSITION
au.gov.health.rdh.ehr1                  -- id of creating system
2                                       -- current version
```

This 3-part tuple is known as a "Version locator" and is defined by the class `OBJECT_VERSION_ID`
in the support.identification package. A `VERSION` can be _referred to_ using a normal
`OBJECT_REF` that contains a copy of the version’s `OBJECT_VERSION_ID`. The openEHR version
identification scheme is described in detail in the `change_control` package section of the Common IM.

The last component of identification is the path, used to refer to an interior node of a top-level structure
identified by its Version locator. Paths in openEHR follow an Xpath style syntax, with slight
abbreviations to shorten paths in the most common cases. Paths are described in detail below.
To refer to an interior data node from outside a top-level structure, a combination of a Version locator
and a path is required. This is formalised in the `LOCATABLE_REF` class in the identification
package section of the Support IM. A Universal Resource Identifier (URI) form can also be used,
defined by the data type `DV_EHR_URI` (<<openehr_rm_data_types>>). This type provides a single string expression
in the scheme-space "ehr:" which can be used to refer to an interior data node from anywhere (it can
also be used to represent queries; see below). Any `LOCATABLE_REF` can be converted to a
`DV_EHR_URI`, although not all `DV_EHR_URIs` are `LOCATABLE_REFs`.

The figure below summarises how various types of `OBJECT_ID` and `OBJECT_REF` are used to identify
objects, and to reference them from the outside, respectively.
