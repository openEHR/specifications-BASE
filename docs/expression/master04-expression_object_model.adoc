= The Expression Object Model

== Overview

The `expression` package defines the Expression Object Model (EOM), a model of 'statements' and 'expressions' that can be used in various contexts in openEHR, including inside archetypes and in GDL guidelines. If the Expression Language or other syntax-based artefact is used, the model described here defines the parser output in the form of an expression tree. Other openEHR models designed for a particular purpose may reuse the `expression` package and further specialise some of its types specifically intended for extension.

The package structure of the `expression` package is shown below.

== Core Package

The main `expression` packages `core` and `extension` are illustrated below.

A group of statements to be used together is formally defined as one or more `STATEMENTs` in a `STATEMENT_SET`. There are three types of statements corresponding to the classes `ASSERTION`, `VARIABLE_DECLARATION` and `ASSIGNMENT`. Assertions consist of an expression tree structure that evaluates to a `Boolean` value. The root of the tree is a descendant of the class `EXPR_ITEM` that represents a Boolean-returning operator or value. An Assertion has an optional tag, enabling it to be named. 

A `VARIABLE_DECLARATION` enables a named variable to be declared with a type, which must be one of the descendants of `EXPR_DEF_TYPE`.

The `ASSIGNMENT` class defines the usual operation of assigning a value (the `_source_` i.e. the notional right-hand side) to a variable, (the `_target_`, i.e. left-hand side). The source of an assignment can be any Expression or an `EXTERNAL_QUERY`, which are sub-types of `EXPR_VALUE`.

=== Expressions

Expressions are fully described statement values that may be evaluated internally (as compared to an external query) and are defined by the `EXPR_XXX` classes. The Expression classes model a typical evaluation tree each of whose nodes is either a leaf or an operator node. The semantics of Expressions are described in the <<language-expressions, Expressions>> sub-section in the Language section.

In this model, function calls are treated as leaf nodes rather than tree nodes, which would be more typical of a functional language meta-model. The leaf node approach used here treats function calls as black boxes requiring an evaluation method, enabling the main expression tree to be evaluated by use of a standard set of operators whose semantics can be safely built in.

Operator semantics are defined by the class `OPERATOR_DEF`, which includes the two attributes `_name_` and `_symbols_` which define the name of the operator and its allowable symbols respectively.

=== Other Statement Elements

==== External Query

An `EXTERNAL_QUERY` is a type of expression representing a call to an external service which obtains a value for it. This enables information items from the exterior computational environment to be treated as abstract typed values within expressions.

The type system of the Expression formalism is defined via the type `EXPR_TYPE_DEF` and its descendants. All types have a `_type_name_` and a `_type_anchor_`, which is a variable of the coresponding primtive type from within the openEHR `base_types` package, i.e. `Integer`, `Real`, `String`, etc. The type anchor can be used for testing assignments within the implementation. A special type `TYPE_DEF_OBJECT` is included to enable a value reference (descendant of `EXPR_VALUE_REF`) to refer to a complex object, to which some expression operators can be applied, including equality and existence. The types system is extensible, as described below.
